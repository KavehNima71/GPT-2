## Overview:
OpenAI GPT-2 model was proposed in [**Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners**](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) by Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei and Ilya Sutskever from OpenAI.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset[1] of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.

GPT-2 is available in five different sizes: small, medium, large, xl and a distilled version of the small checkpoint: distilgpt-2.

## Dataset:
Dataset [**TinyStories**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) containing synthetically short stories that only contain words that a typical 3 to 4-year-olds usually understand, generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. This dataset is designed to train and evaluate small language (LM) models that are capable of producing coherent narratives despite limited parameters.

Described in the following paper: [**https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759.**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759)

**Structure:**

  Thousands of short stories (a few paragraphs each) with:
   - Simple Vocabulary: Basic words and straightforward sentence structures.
   - Diverse Genres: Fantasy, adventure, everyday scenarios, etc.
   - Clear Narratives: Defined beginnings, middles, and ends, often with moral lessons.

A sample story from TinyStories:
> One day, a little girl named Lily found a needle in her room. She knew it was difficult to play with it because it was sharp. Lily wanted to share the needle with her mom, so she could sew a button on her shirt. Lily went to her mom and said, "Mom, I found this needle. Can you share it with me and sew my shirt?" Her mom smiled and said, "Yes, Lily, we can share the needle and fix your shirt." Together, they shared the needle and sewed the button on Lily's shirt. It was not difficult for them because they were sharing and helping each other. After they finished, Lily thanked her mom for sharing the needle and fixing her shirt. They both felt happy because they had shared and worked together.
